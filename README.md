## Introduction

Socialite .NET offers a sleek and intuitive interface for OAuth authentication across platforms like Bitbucket, Facebook, GitHub, GitLab, Google, LinkedIn, Slack, Twitch, and X. It takes care of the tedious social authentication boilerplate so you can focus on building your application.

**We will not implement new adapters.**
